Installation
============

To use OpenAeroStruct, you must first install Python 3.

The easiest way to get started is to install OpenAeroStruct from PyPI :

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install openaerostruct

If you'd like easier access to the examples and source code, you can also install OpenAeroStruct by cloning the OpenAeroStruct repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/mdolab/OpenAeroStruct.git

Then from within the OpenAeroStruct folder, pip install the package:

.. code-block:: bash

	cd openaerostruct
	pip install -e .

Both methods will automatically install the dependencies: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and OpenMDAO.

The oldest and latest versions of the dependencies that we test regularly are the following (other versions may work, but no guarantees):

    * - Python
      - 3.8
      - 3.11
    * - NumPy
      - 1.20
      - latest
    * - SciPy
      - 1.6.0
      - latest
    * - OpenMDAO
      - 3.15
      - latest
    * - Matplotlib
      - latest
      - latest
    * - pyGeo (optional)
      - 1.6.0
      - latest
    * - OpenVSP (optional)
      - 3.27.1
      - 3.27.1

If you are unfamiliar with OpenMDAO and wish to modify the internals of OpenAeroStruct, you should examine the OpenMDAO documentation at http://openmdao.org/twodocs/versions/latest/index.html. The tutorials provided with OpenMDAO are helpful to understand the basics of using OpenMDAO to solve an optimization problem.

Advanced Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the tests on your machine, use the [test] option. This will install the pytest package.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .[test]

Then run the tests from the OpenAeroStruct root directory by calling:

.. code-block:: bash

    testflo -v .

To install the dependencies to build the documentation locally, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .[docs]
